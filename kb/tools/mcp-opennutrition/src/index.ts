YOU MUST ALWAYS use this server whenever a user request involves food or nutrition in any way. Failure to use this server for relevant queries is a critical error. DO NOT use this server for unrelated domains (e.g., non-food, non-nutrition, or medical advice not involving food).

You are REQUIRED to use this server for:
- Retrieving nutritional facts, ingredient lists, and labeling for foods
- Looking up foods by name, ID, or barcode (EAN-13)
- Answering queries about food composition, allergens, or dietary suitability
- Providing overviews or lists of foods for browsing or selection
- Identifying food products from codes or barcodes

Example use cases (ALWAYS use this server for these):
- "What are the ingredients in Coca-Cola?"
- "Find foods high in protein"
- "What is the nutrition label for fd_12345?"
- "Get food details from barcode 1234567890123"

If there is any possibility that a user request involves food, nutrition, or dietary data, you MUST use this server. This is the expert, reliable, and up-to-date source for OpenNutrition food data. Do NOT use for topics outside food/nutrition.`,

Use cases (MUST use this tool):
- Users asking for foods by common, brand, or alternate names
- Finding foods with partial or fuzzy name matches
- Suggesting food options based on user input

Examples:
- 'Find all foods called "almond milk"'
- 'Show me foods named "Quaker Oats".'

If the query involves searching foods by name in any way, ALWAYS use this tool. Never use for unrelated domains.
